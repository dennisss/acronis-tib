Data types we still need samples for
====================================

1. Sector-by-sector HDD backup with sparely allocated sectors (only applies to Windows)

2. Windows/macOS full disk backup (not sector-by-sector, but file based)

3. Large files that span multiple record (> 262KB in size) (both on Mac and Windows)

4. File bases samples with exclusions specified (macOS + Windows)
